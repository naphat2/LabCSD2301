        <h2>SPIDER MAN MILES MORALES Review</h2>
        <p>
          Rising to the top of the list of the best superhero games for the first time for many people regularly is Marvel's Spider-Man, an exclusive hero game for PlayStation 4 that tells the story and heroes of Peter Parker, a young man who was... Attacks and bites the intestines, gaining superhuman strength. Hearing the story of the game, it perfectly reflects the hero's life. It's hard for any game to compare
          Because the game came out well. Many people therefore want to know more about what's going on in this universe. To be frank, Spider-Man is a comic book with a long history, with many heroes and villains in the storyline. Therefore, there is no doubt that there will be a sequel to the game. Especially leaving something behind at the end of the game to wait for something to take over
          The gameplay of Spider-Man: Miles Morales is, of course, still very similar to the original. Miles Morales' powers are not his only physical characteristics. He can release Venom Blast, which is a power similar to lightning, and can also camouflage himself to match the atmosphere. Adjusted the stealth gameplay to make it more interesting.
